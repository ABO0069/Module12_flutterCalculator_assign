# Flutter Calculator App

A sleek, responsive calculator app built with Flutter, inspired by the iOS calculator design.

This project was built from scratch as a learning exercise, focusing on a clean UI, responsive layout, and state management in Flutter.

## Features

- **Standard Arithmetic:** All basic operations: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`×`), and division (`÷`) &nbsp;
- **Modern UI:** A clean, iOS-inspired design with a two-line display for expressions and results &nbsp;
- **Light/Dark Theme:** An adaptive theme that toggles between light and dark modes &nbsp;
- **Utility Functions:** Includes "All Clear" (`AC`), clear entry (`C`), percent (`%`), delete (`DEL`), and decimal (`.`) functionalities &nbsp;
- **Responsive Layout:** The UI adapts cleanly to different screen sizes

## How to Use

- Press the number and operator buttons to build an expression. &nbsp;
- The top line shows your full expression (e.g., `10 + 5`). &nbsp;
- The bottom line shows your current entry or the result. &nbsp;
- `AC` clears all state, while `C` just clears the current entry. &nbsp;
- `DEL` deletes the last digit of your current entry. &nbsp;
- Press the Sun/Moon icon at the top to toggle between light and dark themes. &nbsp;
