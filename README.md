Flutter Calculator App

A sleek, responsive calculator app built with Flutter, inspired by the iOS calculator design.

This project was built from scratch as a learning exercise, focusing on a clean UI, responsive layout, and state management in Flutter.

Features

Standard Arithmetic: All basic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (×), and division (÷).

Modern UI: A clean, iOS-inspired design with a two-line display for expressions and results.

Light/Dark Theme: A beautiful, an adaptive theme that toggles between light and dark modes.

Utility Functions: Includes "All Clear" (AC), clear entry (C), percent (%), delete (DEL), and decimal (.) functionalities.

Responsive Layout: The UI adapts cleanly to different screen sizes.
